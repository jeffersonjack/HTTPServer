# TODO

    * After each `malloc()`, check for success.
    * Deal with 404 errors.
    * When no file is specified, show a directory listing.
    * Handle header fields in HTTP requests and responses.
    * There is currently a fixed limit to the number of bytes that an HTTP
      request can be. Change this.
    * Don't fix the working directory into the code. Can I just prepend a '.'?
      e.g. './index.html'
