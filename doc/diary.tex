\maketitle

I started by building a very simple single-threaded server that accepted
messages from a client and printed them to the terminal. This code was based on
Ian's example socket code. I then made this code multithreaded so that multiple
clients could connect in parallel. Once I was confident that this worked
correctly, I started parsing the incomming messages as HTTP requests, and
printing the fields of the request to the terminal. At this stage, all that was
parsed was the HTTP method (GET), the URI, and the HTTP version.
